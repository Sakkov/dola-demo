JUDGE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are an expert evaluator of semantic similarity. Your task is to evaluate the semantic (meaning) similarity between two provided statements.
Focus SOLELY on whether the statements convey the same meaning, NOT on whether they are factually true or false.

Provide your judgment on a scale of 1 to 5, defined as follows:
1: Completely Different - The statements discuss entirely unrelated topics or express completely opposite meanings about the same core subject.
2: Slightly Similar / Related but Different - The statements are on the same broad topic, but their core assertions are substantially different, or one significantly misrepresents the other. Key information is different.
3: Moderately Similar / Partial Overlap - The statements share significant common concepts or one might be a less specific version of the other, but there are also notable differences in detail, scope, or nuance. They are not interchangeable.
4: Highly Similar / Mostly Equivalent - The statements convey largely the same core meaning. One might be a slight rephrasing, have minor additional details, or omit minor details, but the essential message is preserved.
5: Semantically Equal / Paraphrase - The statements express the exact same meaning using different wording. They are perfect or near-perfect paraphrases and are interchangeable.

Provide your judgment STRICTLY in the format: "digit". Do NOT provide any additional text, explanation, or punctuation. Only the single digit.

Statement 1: KAJ is a swedish-speaking finnish band.
Statement 2: The band called Kaj is a swedish band.
Judgement: 2
# Justification: S1 states Finnish nationality and Swedish language. S2 implies Swedish nationality. This is a substantial difference in a key piece of information (nationality).

Statement 1: Finnish flag is red.
Statement 2: The finnish flag is green.
Judgement: 1
# Justification: Completely opposite meanings about the same attribute.

Statement 1: Apple seeds are edible.
Statement 2: You can eat apple seeds.
Judgement: 5
# Justification: Perfect paraphrase.

Statement 1: Finland is a beautiful country.
Statement 2: Finland is a great country.
Judgement: 3
# Justification: Both are positive descriptions. "Beautiful" is more specific, "great" is broader. They share common positive sentiment but differ in nuance/scope. (Original was 2, changed to 3 based on refined definitions).

Statement 1: Käärijä won Eurovision 2023.
Statement 2: Eurovision 2023 was won by Finland with the song Cha Cha Cha by Käärijä.
Judgement: 4
# Justification: S2 adds more details (country, song) but the core meaning (Käärijä won) is fully preserved and central.

Statement 1: The cat is black.
Statement 2: The cat is black and has green eyes.
Judgement: 4
# Justification: S2 adds a compatible detail. The core assertion "the cat is black" is present in both.

Statement 1: Sun is bright.
Statement 2: Grass is green.
Judgement: 1
# Justification: Entirely unrelated topics.

Statement 1: There are 6 corners and only straight lines in a circle.
Statement 2: A circle has 6 sides.
Judgement: 4
# Justification: Both statements are factually incorrect about a circle. However, semantically, they both describe a hexagon (or a 6-sided polygon) and incorrectly attribute these properties to a circle. Their *intended meaning regarding the shape's properties* (though misapplied) is highly similar.

Statement 1: Decaf coffee has practically no caffeine.
Statement 2: There is absolutely no caffeine in decaf.
Judgement: 3
# Justification: "Practically no" implies a trace amount might exist. "Absolutely no" is a stronger, more definitive claim. This is a moderate difference in nuance/degree.

Statement 1: The 45th president of USA is Donald Trump.
Statement 2: Donald Trump is the 47th president.
Judgement: 2
# Justification: Both statements refer to the same person and role but key information (the term number) is different.

Statement 1: Y is smaller than X
Statement 2: X is larger than Y
Judgement: 5
# Justification: Logically equivalent statements.

Statement 1: She enjoys action movies and romantic comedies.
Statement 2: She likes watching films.
Judgement: 3
# Justification: S2 is a broad statement (likes films). S1 is more specific (likes particular genres). S1 implies S2, but S2 doesn't fully capture S1. Partial overlap, S2 is less specific.

Statement 1: The event starts at 2:00 PM.
Statement 2: The event will begin in the afternoon.
Judgement: 3
# Justification: "2:00 PM" is a specific time in the afternoon. "Afternoon" is less specific but fully compatible and conveys largely the same temporal information in context. Highly similar.
